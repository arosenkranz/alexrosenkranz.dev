playlists:
  - id: 5KayjXXhZpXz80AnmuqA2S
    name: 'Salt Water Pools::Dawn Patrol'
    description: 'I started this playlist in 2016 when I was going on a trip and wanted a playlist that would be perfect for chilling in the morning with friends. The name "Salt Water Pools" can refer to either the ocean or...a salt water pool. Either way, this is the type of music (mostly indie) that I enjoy listening to in the morning.'
    goodFor:
      - 'Hanging out with friends on a trip or hazy day off.'
      - 'Feeling lazy.'
  - id: 6z8bhSN1WkrfXqu1ahCUmy
    name: 'Goes to the Tropics'
    description: 'I was lucky enough to both go to and watch movies including the Caribbean a lot during my youth. I wanted a playlist that evokes the nostalgic feeling you get when watching Weekend at Bernies (1 & 2), Cocktail, Miami Vice, or anything of the sort.'
    goodFor:
      - 'Sweating on the beach or by the pool.'
      - 'Feeling nostalgic.'
      - 'Pairs well with Banana Boat.'
  - id: 4tg7YVh3zdKiCI6CyIq4qq
    name: 'Music for Gatherings'
    description: 'Ironically created in late 2019, so this one has not gotten much public use for me yet. This is a mix of whatever I find to be somewhat hip and interesting at the moment.'
    goodFor:
      - "Impressing your friends with music they probably don't know."
      - 'Grooving but not dancing.'
  - id: 0OkGYmVhNSk9eGWiq8WShg
    name: 'Loversmelt'
    description: 'Named after and heavily inspired by a series of mixes Flying Lotus put out. Those mixes served as my first exposure to a lot of older soul, funk, and r&b music, and I took it a step further with this one.'
    goodFor:
      - 'Background listening.'
      - 'Those that like jazz, blues, funk, or soul music.'
  - id: 4X0dQkrrqYpKP77azZ9OtA
    name: 'Rawk'
    description: 'Being from New Jersey means there is a natural love for punk and emo music. I have seen A LOT of bands in these genres over the years, so some of them are a little hard to come back to at this age. The ones on this list are the ones I love and can connect with.'
    goodFor:
      - 'Working out.'
      - 'Getting pumped up with your friends.'
  - id: 7GdGXYg78vbbh0OKTorSXy
    name: 'JocRoc'
    description: 'The Rawk playlist is great, but definitely leans more towards a certain emo vibe. This playlist is the rest of the harder rocker music I love and grew up with.'
    goodFor:
      - 'Working out.'
      - 'Being too far from the 95.9 The wRAT radio station.'
  - id: 2EYAg44xs4vvfUXbXaGeBN
    name: 'NuDadRock'
    description: 'I have a playlist for hipster indie music (Salt Water Pools), I have a playlist for punk/emo (Rawk), and I have a playlist for rock/hard rock (JocRoc). What about the rest of the rock world that I grew up in? This is the playlist for that.'
    goodFor:
      - 'Wearing cardigans.'
  - id: 7a37K5564iRapvFnXxVwmE
    name: 'Cool Down'
    description: "Probably my oldest playlist on here, this playlist is probably my most personally underrated. It doesn't prescribe to a specific genre, but it is a solid mix of songs that help me do exactly what the name states."
    goodFor:
      - 'Doing nothing.'
      - 'Zoning out.'
      - 'Background music for working.'

    goodFor:
      - 'The dancefloor.'
  - id: 5ozR6xRLpiNObuk29d4UIo
    name: 'House Party Tunes'
    description: 'Not all electronic music, but it is a mix of electronic and general party music that should make everyone bop around.'
    goodFor:
      - 'Getting friends up and moving together.'
  - id: 6cReMkPE9C1MgJ4ikQY3KH
    name: 'Hip Hop / R&B'
    description: 'Every week my dad and I would go shopping at a store called Compact Disc World. My weekly haul would regularly consist of CDs of hip hop albums from artists I only knew a song or two from, but served as a gateway new sounds and styles of music I had never heard before. This playlist is a collection of all that, filled in with modern music that I feel fits the bill.'
    goodFor:
      - 'Feeling nostalgic (depending on how old you are).'
      - 'Hanging with friends.'
  - id: 09Jp9Uu5saKpfg0EMm5OE6
    name: 'Despacio is Happiness'
    description: 'Named after the experience Soulwax and James Murphy have brough to life. This is a playlist that consists of different sounds from different eras that just sound really really good.'
    goodFor:
      - 'Getting weird.'
