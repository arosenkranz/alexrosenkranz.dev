## About me

I'm a software engineer and technical curriculum developer based in New Jersey with 15+ years of experience in tech, both small and large. I'm passionate about learning and teaching, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and help others do the same.

I'm currently on the [Customer Education team at Datadog](https://learn.datadoghq.com), where I help create and maintain tooling and content to help our customers learn how to use our products for both asynchronous and instructor-led training.

## About this site

This site doesn't exist to promote myself or my work, you can see what I'm up to on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexrosenkranz/), [GitHub](https://github.com/arosenkranz), or the [Datadog Learning Center](https://learn.datadoghq.com) if you're interested in that. Instead, I'll use this space to talk about things I'm interested in, things I'm learning, and things I'm doing.

This site is written in TypeScript/JavaScript using the [Astro](https://astro.build) framework and uses a little bit of React for some interactions. TailwindCSS is used for styling, and most of the content is written in Markdown. I used the [astro-paper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme as a base for the site and updated it to fit my needs

It's a mostly static site, aside from the <strong>Now Playing</strong> section towards the bottom of the page, which polls an API endpoint to check what I'm currently listening to on Spotify. I also aim to make it as accessible as possible.
