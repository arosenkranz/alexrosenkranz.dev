> "What really matters is what you like, not what you are like… Books, records, films – these things matter." ~ Rob Gordon, High Fidelity

Rob Gordon may not be the most admirable character, but he's right about one thing: the things we like and are interested in help provide insight into who we are.

This page is a collection of things I've been into lately, because everyone loves a list! It's a mix of things I've been reading, playing, watching, listening to, and whatever else I find worth sharing.

## Music

I'm a big fan of music, and I'm always on the lookout for new stuff to listen to and add them to playlists across multiple platforms.

### Yearly lists

A collection of songs from each year I was into. There's no order to these, and they're not necessarily the best songs of the year (which is incredibly subjective), just the ones I liked the most.

- [tracks_2024 (spotify)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3ziWs63jsY5dQlIK6bJKpO?si=277213d5876643b4)
- [tracks_2023 (spotify)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2K1zbdzZbbKlVrjQZugGZG?si=2fa9c97c34664515)
- [tracks_2022 (spotify)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/53bDc9wY4zHupAy0dQNCDs?si=bd89ec1b4dc7447e)
- [tracks_2021 (spotify)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4Um2SSeKoErMOGECwRRwrx?si=8235a2f101a54f59)

### Genre/mood playlists

Playlists I constantly update and rotate songs in and out of.

- [rawk (spotify)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4X0dQkrrqYpKP77azZ9OtA?si=681d9c1913784c0f) - punk, hardcore, pop punk, etc.
- [breakfastblend (spotify)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3VhvjGTVBiIriamiB2UU7K?si=375bead36ceb4f20) - too eclectic to describe
- [salt_water_pools (spotify)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5KayjXXhZpXz80AnmuqA2S?si=4bc94e3efe0246f2) - think 2008-2014 pitchfork-era music and some other stuff
- [goes_to_the_tropics (spotify)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6z8bhSN1WkrfXqu1ahCUmy?si=e8e9401d6b2743f9) - nudisco, tropical, synthwave, and other stuff that makes me feel like I'm on vacation
- [club_krünz (spotify)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5YhyVUBgjWS4PHXUtUTAP9?si=92cf3cdd71b94910) - house, techno, and other electronic music
- [cool_down (spotify)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7a37K5564iRapvFnXxVwmE?si=b1796ee6bdca493f) - chill music for when you need to relax

## Sites / Blogs

I love Reddit as much as the next person, but I've been trying to spend more time on sites and blogs that are more focused and less... Reddit-y. Here are a few I've been enjoying lately:

I use [Feedly](https://feedly.com) and [Substack](https://substack.com/@alexrosenkranz/reads) to keep up with most of these.

_Will be adding some links here soon_
