This is a collection of things I've been into lately. It's a mix of things I've been reading, watching, listening to, and more. I hope you find something interesting here!

It bums me out that so many people spend their time on only a handful of sites and apps, having the same experience over and over. I think the internet is a lot more interesting when you explore a bit and I hope I can help you find something new and interesting.

First, let's talk about how this site is built...

## Tech Stack

This site is written in TypeScript/JavaScript using the Astro framework and uses a little bit of React for some interactions. TailwindCSS is used for styling, and most of the content is written in Markdown.

It's a mostly static site, aside from the nifty <strong>Now Playing</strong> section towards the bottom of the page, which polls an API route to check on what I'm currently listening to on Spotify. I also aim to make it as accessible as possible.

To give credit where credit is due, I used the [astro-paper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme as a base for the site and updated it to fit my needs.
